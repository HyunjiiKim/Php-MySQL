# PHP & MySQL Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with PHP and MySQL. It contains code examples, exercises, and projects that I work through while studying a PHP & MySQL book. The goal is to solidify my understanding of these technologies and apply them in practical scenarios.

## Contents

- **PHP Scripts**: A collection of PHP code examples and exercises that demonstrate different features and techniques, such as handling forms, interacting with databases, and managing user sessions.
- **MySQL Scripts**: SQL queries and scripts used to create, manage, and manipulate databases. These include table creation, data insertion, and other SQL operations.
- **Projects**: Small projects that combine both PHP and MySQL to build dynamic web applications. These might include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, login systems, and more.

## Learning Goals

- Master the fundamentals of PHP, including syntax, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Learn how to interact with MySQL databases using PHP for tasks like data retrieval, insertion, and updating.
- Understand the concepts of form handling, user authentication, and security in web development.
- Build simple yet functional web applications that utilize PHP and MySQL together.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code on your local machine, you'll need to set up a local server environment such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. These packages come with PHP, MySQL, and Apache server, making it easier to get started.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyunjiikim/php-mysql-learning.git
```

### 2. . Set up the MySQL Database
Run the MySQL scripts from the mysql directory to create and set up your database tables. You'll need to update the database connection settings in the PHP scripts as needed.

### 3. Accessing the Code
Open the project folder in your local development environment and start your server. You can access your scripts via the browser by navigating to http://localhost/Php-MySQL.
