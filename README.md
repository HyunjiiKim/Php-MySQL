# PHP & MySQL Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with PHP and MySQL. It contains code examples, exercises, and projects that I work through while studying a PHP & MySQL book. The goal is to solidify my understanding of these technologies and apply them in practical scenarios.

## Contents

- **PHP Scripts**: A collection of PHP code examples and exercises that demonstrate different features and techniques, such as handling forms, interacting with databases, and managing user sessions.
- **MySQL Scripts**: SQL queries and scripts used to create, manage, and manipulate databases. These include table creation, data insertion, and other SQL operations.
- **Projects**: Small projects that combine both PHP and MySQL to build dynamic web applications. These might include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, login systems, and more.

## Learning Goals

- Master the fundamentals of PHP, including syntax, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Learn how to interact with MySQL databases using PHP for tasks like data retrieval, insertion, and updating.
- Understand the concepts of form handling, user authentication, and security in web development.
- Build simple yet functional web applications that utilize PHP and MySQL together.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code on your local machine, you'll need to set up a local server environment such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. These packages come with PHP, MySQL, and Apache server, making it easier to get started.
